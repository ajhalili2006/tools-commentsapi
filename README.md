This is a [giscus] instance used as a service for @recaptime-dev and friends, powered by [GitHub Discussions][discussions].

There are two instances that @ajhalili2006 run for this service, all which uses the same GitHub app credentials while working around CORS and DNS-level blocking related issues:

* <https://comments.andreijiroh.xyz> - Andrei Jiroh's
* <https://comments.recaptime.dev> and <https://comments.lorebooks.eu.org> -

[discussions]: https://docs.github.com/en/discussions

## How it works

When giscus loads, the [GitHub Discussions search API][search-api] is used to find the Discussion associated with the page based on a chosen mapping (URL, `pathname`, `<title>`, etc.). If a matching discussion cannot be found, the giscus bot will automatically create a discussion the first time someone leaves a comment or reaction.

To comment, visitors must authorize the [giscus app][giscus-app] to [post on their behalf][authorization] using the GitHub OAuth flow. Alternatively, visitors can comment on the GitHub Discussion directly. You can moderate the comments on GitHub.

If you're using giscus, consider [starring ðŸŒŸ the upstream repo on GitHub][repo] and adding the [`giscus`][giscus-topic] topic [to your repository][topic-howto]! ðŸŽ‰

## Migrating

If you've previously used other systems that utilize GitHub Issues (e.g. [utterances][utterances], [gitalk][gitalk]), you can [convert the existing issues into discussions][convert]. After the conversion, just make sure that the mapping between the discussion titles and the pages are correct, then giscus will automatically use the discussions.
